# STM32F407 and LCD1602 Dynamic Digital Clock

This program employs an LCD1602 display dynamically to exhibit the current date and time, utilizing I2C communication with a **PCF8574** I/O expansion chip integrated. It contemplates the utilization of the **I2C-1** channel, thereby assigning the SDA line to pin PB7 and the SCL line to pin PB6 on the board. The operational logic involves the initial configuration of time and date settings once (note that after each code regeneration in CubeMX, the parentheses at 'User Code 2' in the initialization function in `rtc.c` must be shifted to precede the configuration of wake-up and alarm interrupts). Additionally, it configures alarm time settings, including mask bits to indicate which specific time standards to exclude from checking, such as hours or dates. Subsequently, it enables both wake-up and alarm interrupts. Each time the wake-up interrupt triggers, the external variable 'updateLCD' is modified, prompting the `main()` function's while loop to transmit data to the display via I2C for current time representation. Simultaneously, upon activation of the alarm interrupt, the display is turned off, wake-up interrupts are disabled, and 'updateLCD' is reset.
